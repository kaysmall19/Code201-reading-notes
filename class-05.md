Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)

Vocabulary/Notes

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world.

Property is a variable part of an object.

Methods are a function of an object.

A key is properties and methods that have a name and value in an object.

Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs(but the names are referred to as keys.)

Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.

A dot notation is to access a property or method of an object you use the name of the object, followed by a period, then the name of the property or method you want to access.

A period is known as a member operator.

Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)

Vocabulary/Notes

The DOM is stored in the browers' memory and consists of four main types of node.

The document node is added to the top to represent the entire page.

The terms elememt and element nodes are used interchangeably but when people say the DOM is working with an element, it is actually working with a node that represents that element.

Methods that find elements in the DOM tree are called DOM queries.

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a NodeList, which is a collection of nodes.

getElementId() and querySelector() can both search an entire document and return individual elements.

Array synatax is preferred over the item() method because it is faster.

Summary

Browers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.

You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

In older browers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery.)s
