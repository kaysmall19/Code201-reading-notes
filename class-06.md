Domain Modeling

Vocabulary/Notes

Domain Modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

Object-oriented model is an entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaivors in methods.

Constructor function is to define the same properties between amny objects.

Summary

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)

Vocabulary/Notes

A table represents information in a grid format.

Table element is used to create a table.

TR (table row) tag start of each row using the opening.

TD (table data) element is each cell of table.

TH (table heading) element is used just to represent the heading for either a column or a row.

Summary

You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

Vocabluary/Notes

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

Some functions return information to the code that called them.

Global variables use more memory.

Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world.

Objects constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.

The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.

Arrays are actually a special type of object.

You can combine objects and arrays to create complex data structures.

Browers come with a set of built-in objects that reprsent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window.

Object model is a group of objects, each of which represent related things from the real world.

The window object represents the current browser window or tab.

Document Object Model (DOM) represents the web page loaded into the current browser window or tab.

In JavaScript there are six data types: five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types. The sixth is the object (and is referred to as complex data type.)

Summary

Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

JavaScript alsohas several bulit-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
